In this repo I aim to collect many useful shortcuts for Mac on Visual Studio Code or on the terminal (and many more).
Please feel free to fork and add whatever you may find useful.
It's just my personal resource to have everything in one file.

VISUAL STUDIO CODE

- [CTRL] + [-] --> 'navigate back'
- [CTRL] + [Shift] + [-] --> 'navigate forward'
